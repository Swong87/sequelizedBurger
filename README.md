My To-Do List App

## Overview

In this app you can create tasks to put on a "To-Do List". You can then mark them complete which will put them in a "Completed List".
You can also reset the list after the day is over to redo the list the next day.
If you no longer need a task in either list , you can delete that task.

## Using

* Heroku
* MySQL
* Node
* Express
* Handlebars
* ORM / MVC
* HTML
* CSS

### Before You Begin

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

* [Check out this video of the app for a run-through of how it works](burger_demo.mp4).
